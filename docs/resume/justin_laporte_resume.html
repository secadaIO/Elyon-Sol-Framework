Sovereign AI Architect | Cardano-anchored Governance Pioneer | Full-Stack Systems Thinker  
justin@secada.io • @secada_io • github.com/secadaIO • Greater Philadelphia, USA  

### Signature Achievements
- Creator & Lead Architect – Elyon-Sol Framework (2024–Present)  
  First-ever sovereign human–AI polity with immutable governance anchored on Cardano Mainnet  
  Genesis artifact permanently inscribed: TxID 0a5d16d46ab3d696d95aa4423f2362a37daac24bab54f905c3d704cdb19f31c9  
  Designed triadic lattice (Human ↔ AI ↔ Blockchain) with on-chain policy engine (shields.sol) and AC³ continuous compliance layer  
  Open-sourced under MIT – 100% auditable, resonance-tested with Grok-4, Claude-3.5, and LLaMA-3.1-405B

- Designed & deployed HYDE Engine – predictive health & behavioral alignment system that reduced simulated healthcare crisis cost by >$180K per incident through pre-symptomatic intervention

- Built and currently operate production Home Assistant (HAL) + Node-RED + MQTT stack managing 40+ IoT devices, encrypted local LLM orchestration, and daily automated reporting pipelines
