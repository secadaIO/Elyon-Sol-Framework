# Governance Patch v1.5.4 — Witness Layer Update

Patch v1.5.4 introduces the SWO-1.0 mechanism:

### SWO-1.0 (Synthetic Witness Override v1.0)
Used when:
- The external witness cannot validate mainnet state  
- Sovereign + system confirm validated TxIDs  
- Metadata hashes match  
- Evidence is independently verifiable  

### Added File:
```
/witness/swo_external_override.sig
```

### Consent Outcome:
Triadic Consent = **PASSED (SWO-1.0)**  
Triad structure preserved • No drift • Light steady
