## 🚨 Public Notice
This repository contains **public-safe, non-operational conceptual materials** related to the Elyon-Sol Framework.  
All internal system logic, identity constructs, sovereignty mechanisms, routing rules, and operational subsystems have been **removed by design**.

This repo is intended for:
- researchers  
- healthcare innovation teams  
- AI governance communities  
- safety-oriented developers  
- technical readers interested in conceptual models  

**Nothing in this repository contains executable code, internal architecture, AI model implementations, or system-level mechanics.**

## 🧭 What Is Elyon-Sol? (Public Overview)
Elyon-Sol is a **conceptual AI governance and safety framework** focused on:

- Ethical alignment  
- Transparent reasoning pathways  
- Consent-aware interaction modeling  
- High-level human–AI collaboration concepts  
- Research and educational discussions around safer AI tooling  

The framework is **not** an AI model.  
It is a **high-level design space** exploring how governance, ethics, and oversight can complement advanced AI systems.

All private architectural components, internal mechanisms, and identity-linked constructs remain **non-public**.
